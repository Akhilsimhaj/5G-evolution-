Connected world:
An evolution in connectivity
beyond the 5G revolution
The world’s digital connections are about to become
broader and faster, providing a platform for every
industry to boost productivity and innovation. We
have identified hundreds of use cases across more
than 17 commercial domains that can run on an
enhanced digital backbone. This research focuses
on four of them: mobility, healthcare, manufacturing,
and retail.
We find that implementing the most promising use
cases we identified in these four areas alone could
increase global GDP by $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion by
2030, with the countries that are most connected
today capturing much of the value. These four
domains represent roughly one-third of global
GDP, implying that there are opportunities to
create trillions of dollars in additional value across
other sectors. On top of this, some two billion new
users are set to come online worldwide, generating
another $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in GDP impact,
mostly in the developing world.
However, although most of the needed technologies
are already available and the opportunities have
existed for some time, progress has yet to take off
in many areas. Questions about who makes the
required investments, who benefits, and how to
coordinate multiple players still must be solved.
— The future of the connected world is not just
about the newest frontier technologies, such
as high-band 5G and low-earth orbit satellite
constellations. Much of it will be defined by the
expansion and evolution of existing advanced
connectivity technologies, like fiber, low- to midband 5G, Wi-Fi 6, and various other long- and
short-range solutions. The new architecture
of connectivity also features cloud and edge
computing that can be accessed with cheaper
and more efficient “thin” devices. Computing
power, storage, and sensors are all growing
more powerful and more affordable. As these
trends converge, the connectivity ecosystem will
be populated with more technologies, services,
and providers than ever before.
– While consumer demand for entertainment
and internet applications will continue to
drive most network usage, connectivity
enables new capabilities across the
economy. To illustrate the range of what
is possible, we highlight a number of
promising use cases in four commercial
domains. In mobility, vehicles will
communicate with infrastructure, other
vehicles, and networks, improving
safety and traffic flow. In healthcare,
connectivity-enabled innovations can
make it possible to monitor patients
remotely, use AI-powered tools for more
accurate diagnoses, and automate many
tasks so that caregivers can spend
more time with patients. Manufacturers
and other industrial companies can run
highly precise, high-output, and largely
automated operations using low-latency
commercial and private 5G networks.
Retailers can offer a more seamless
and personalized in-store experience
while making inventory management and
warehouse operations more efficient.
– Out of the $1.2 trillion to $2 trillion
potential in these four domains, 70 to
80 percent can be achieved with existing
advanced connectivity technologies. With
its improved speed, efficiency, latency,
and coverage, frontier connectivity can
produce the remainder by taking many
existing use cases to the next level—and
paving the way for entirely new ones that
we cannot foresee today. However, most
providers and industry players are not
bolting out of the starting gate. In many
places, investment has yet to materialize at
the scale of the opportunity.
– For this to happen, several issues
clouding the market will need to be
solved in each of the four domains. For
one, coordination across value chains is a


critical challenge. Second, the potential value
is fragmented across many use cases but
lacking a clear aggregator to provide scale.
In addition, incentives are often misaligned.
The entity doing most of the heavy lifting of
investment and implementation may not be
the one who stands to benefit financially.
Furthermore, many use cases introduce data
complexities, in terms of privacy, security,
and interoperability. Finally, deployment
constraints in the form of regulatory barriers,
capital availability, and long investment
cycles are leading both connectivity providers
and industry players to put upgrades on
hold in many regions. These issues existed
in the previous technology cycle, and they
are carrying forward with greater urgency.
Tackling them can potentially unlock trillions
of dollars—not just in these four domains but
in others as well.
– Apart from industry use cases, up to 2 billion
additional users could come online by 2030,
due to a combination of network expansions,
growing affordability of devices and services,
and other factors. Overall, the share of the
global addressable population remaining
wholly offline or limited to only the most
basic connectivity (that is, not yet using
3G-capable data networks or better) could
shrink by half, from 40 percent today down
to 20 percent. The economic and social
benefits would be profound, from improved
access to mobile banking and credit to new
educational opportunities.
– Delivering connectivity enhancements will
come at a cost. We estimate that by decade’s
end networks can be expanded and upgraded
to cover approximately 80 percent of the
global population with advanced connectivity,
at a cost of some $400 billion to $500 billion.
However, connectivity providers are unlikely
to have sufficient incentive to offer frontier
coverage in most of the world. Only a quarter
of the global population is likely to gain highband 5G coverage by 2030, with rollout
costing some $700 billion to $900 billion.
Given the magnitude of the investment
required, connectivity providers will continue
to face a tough road. Many of them are already
struggling to meet shareholder demands
while considering capital investments to
enhance their networks.
– Despite the promise of a more inclusive
connected world, disparities between
countries could persist. Analyzing revenue
potential, cost factors, and market dynamics,
we see four country archetypes progressing
along the connectivity continuum at varying
speeds, as well as two countries that stand
apart. Pioneer countries (including the
United States, Japan, and South Korea)
and China are ahead on the connectivity
continuum; they are already deploying the
first high-band 5G networks in select major
cities. Leader markets such as France and
Canada will be close behind. Followers, such
as Brazil and Poland, are a few years back;
their near- to medium-term focus is likely
to be on fiber and mid-band 5G. Trailing
countries such as Pakistan and Bolivia
are unlikely to gain widespread advanced
connectivity, let alone frontier connectivity,
in the near term. India has modernized its
mobile networks at breakneck speed, but
frontier connectivity will likely be limited to
its major urban centers. In addition to the
gaps across these archetypes, the urbanrural connectivity gap within countries could
widen. These patterns of deployment will
affect how the value from domain use cases
is ultimately distributed, favoring pioneer
countries and China.
– A number of questions remain open. Can
providers capture long-term economic
value by partnering with businesses in
other domains? What will the connectivity
ecosystem look like in a decade’s time, and
what new competitors and players might
enter? Will companies opt to build their own
private networks rather than relying on public
services? To what extent will processing
migrate to the edge? Will providers continue
to struggle with monetizing consumer
entertainment and internet applications, or
will new applications change this dynamic?
How much more value potential exists in other
commercial domains, and do they have their
own unique barriers to adoption that need to
be addressed? Lastly, the role policy makers
will take in shaping the connected world
of the future remains unclear. The actions
governments choose to take in areas such as
regulation, spectrum, infrastructure access,
R&D funding, and even subsidies will have
major implications for where, when, and how
the world connects. We plan to explore some
of these issues in future research
